/*
      The bridge pattern's intent is to decouple abstraction from its               implemantation so that the two can varry indepentatly
         ir puts abstraction and implementation in two different class
         hierachies so that both can be extend independently

    * Bridge pattern decouple the abstract classs and its implemtation
    * classses by providing a bridge structute between them
    * The bridge uses encapsulation,agregation ,and inhariance to separate
    * responsibility into classes
    * The bridge pattern is useful when both the class and what it does vary,often because changes in the class can be made easily

           The bridge pattern avoid compile-time binding between abstraction and its implemntation
           we can use this pattern to create abstraction between implemtor object in compile time ,and also we can change this implemtor dynamicaly
