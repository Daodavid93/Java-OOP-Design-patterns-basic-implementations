package pattern.abstractFactory;

/*
    The abstract factory pattern is a creational design pattern
    which is realated to the Factory Method Pattern ,but it add another level of abstraction

    When we have sets of object that shere common theme
    and where the client only needs to know how to handle the abstract equivalence of these object i.e the implemtation is not importan

    use of this pattern makes possible to interchange concrete classes
    without to change the code that uses them ,even at runtime
